Team Smite placed 2nd in the Sprint tournament, 3rd in the Seeding tournament, 4th in the HS tournament, and tied for 9th in the Final tournament.


# Sprint Strategy
Our sprint strategy was simple: Rangers and workers. After basic pathfinding was completed, ranger combat code was created and tuned early on in the week. The worker strategy was also simple. Replicate a minimum amount of times (the minimum number was based on the amount of karbonite), and then build factories whenever possible. If workers couldn't build a factory, they moved greedily towards the adjacent square with the most karbonite. Otherwise, they moved randomly. This simple strategy was powerful enough with the initial specifications to place 2nd, losing to JamesX2's Ranger-Healer combination.
